I attempted to connect to the cycle servers but it was simply not working, we spoke about this in class and I was not able to make it back to the lab in order to try using the cycle servers that way.
I did what I could in order to complete this lab but ultimatly was not able to due to not having access to the compiler via the cycle server.
If there is a way that I can try to make these points up in the future I would love the opportunity.
As well I was not able to upload the first practice because of the same reason but the html file is attached
